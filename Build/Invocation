NOTE : **Set your invocation name before doing anything else**


Users say a skill's invocation name to begin an interaction with a particular custom skill.
For example, if the invocation name is "daily horoscopes", users can say:

User: Alexa, ask daily horoscopes for the horoscope for Gemini

Invocation name requirements
Your invocation name should be two or more words, and can contain only lower-case alphabetic characters, spaces between words, possessive apostrophes (for example, "sam's science trivia"), or periods used in abbreviations (for example, "a. b. c."). Other characters like numbers must be spelled out. For example, "twenty one".

Invocation names cannot contain any of the Alexa skill launch phrases such as "launch", "ask", "tell", "open", "load", "begin", and "enable". Wake words including "Alexa", "Amazon", "Echo", "Computer", or the words "skill" or "app" are not allowed. Learn more about invocation names for custom skills.

Skills that include brand names must be submitted by genuine vendors.

Changes to your skill's invocation name will not take effect until you have built your skill's interaction model. In order to successfully build, your skill's interaction model must contain an intent with at least one sample utterance. Learn more about creating interaction models for custom skills.
